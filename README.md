# Blog
 ## description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

 What was your motivation? to try my best to learn JavaScript even when i know i am not the greatest at it even this blog module  i struggled with it and i fear and still fear that this project did not live up to my expectation since i am still new at it and feel that i have not learned JS properly


 Why did you build this project? i built this project my way to try to help me learn JS and to test myself in a way that i would get good feed back on how to improve myself when this project is done.




 What problem does it solve? i honestly do not think or beleive that my problem was solved because javascript is very hard for me to learn so i can only work on it the best i can until it clicks.  until it does this will always be my issue that i work to be better at.
